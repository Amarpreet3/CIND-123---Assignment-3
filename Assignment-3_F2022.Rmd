# Instructions 


This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. Review this website for more details on using R Markdown <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Use RStudio for this assignment. Complete the assignment by inserting your  \texttt{R} code wherever you see the string "#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE".

When you click the **Knit** button, a document (PDF, Word, or HTML format) will be generated that includes both the assignment content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks.

**NOTE**: YOU SHOULD NEVER HAVE `install.packages` IN YOUR CODE; OTHERWISE, THE `Knit` OPTION WILL GIVE AN ERROR. COMMENT OUT ALL PACKAGE INSTALLATIONS.

Submit **both**  the `rmd` and generated `output` files. Failing to submit both files will be subject to mark deduction. PDF or HTML is preferred. 

## Sample Question and Solution

Use `seq()` to create the vector $(3, 5, \dots, 29)$.

```{r}
seq(3, 30, 2)
seq(3, 29, 2)
```



# Question 1 [30 Pts]

## Q1a (10 points) 
The midterm and final exam grades of some students are given as `c(92,91,67,72,85,81,53,45)` and `c(87,100,65,81,93,77,55,36)`. Set variables `midterm` and `final` respectively. Then find the least-squares line relating the midterm to the final exam 

   Does the assumption of a linear relationship appear to be reasonable in this case? Give reasons for your answer as a comment.
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE

```

## Q1b (10 points) 
Plot the midterm as a function of the final exam grades using a scatterplot and graph the least-square line on the same plot. 
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE

```

## Q1c (10 points) 
Use the regression line to predict the midterm grade when the final exam grade is 88. 
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE

```



# Question 2 [45 Pts]

Please load the Crime data by running the following chunk of code.

You can read more about at this link:
   - https://rdrr.io/cran/plm/man/Crime.html
```{r load_data}
library(plm)
data(Crime)
```

## Q2a (5 points) 
Display the first 5 rows of the `Crime` data, the names of all the variables, and a descriptive summary of each variable. 
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE

```

## Q2b (5 points) 
Calculate the mean, variance and standard deviation of the weekly wage in construction (`wcon`) by omitting the missing values, if any. 
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE

```
## Q2c-1 (5 points) 
Use people per square mile (`density`) and police per capita (`polpc`) to build a linear regression model to predict tax per capita (`taxpc`).  

## Q2c-2 (5 points) 
How can you draw a conclusion from the results? 
   (Note: Full marks requires comment on the predictors)
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE
# Q2c-1

#Q2c-2

```

## Q2d (5 points) 

Based on the output of your model, write an equation using the intercept and coefficients of `density` when `polpc`. Then, use the equation for a case with `density` of 0.4 and `polpc` of 0.0015 to predict its tax per capita.  

```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE

```

## Q2e-1 (5 points) 
Find Pearson correlation between crimes committed per person (`crmrte`) and the probability of arrest (`prbarr`); and between percentage minority in 1980 (`pctmin`) and police per capita (`polpc`). 

## Q2e-2 (5 points) 
What conclusions can you draw? Write your reasons as comments.
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE

#Q2e-1

#Q2e-2

```

## Q2f-1 (5 points) 
Display the correlation matrix of the following variables: 
- crimes committed per person (`crmrte`), 
- probability of arrest (`prbarr`),
- probability of conviction (`prbconv`),
- police per capita (`polpc`),
- percentage minority in 1980 (`pctmin`). 

## Q2f-2 (5 points) 
Write what conclusion you can draw, as comments. 
   (answer not included, Please grade on student's comments)
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE
# Q2f-1

# Q2f-2

```



## Question 3 [25 Pts]

This question makes use of package "ISwR". Please load `airquality` dataset as following:

```{r}
# or install.packages("ISwR")
library(ISwR) 
data(airquality)
str(airquality)
```


## Q3a (7.5 points) 
Use a histogram to assess the normality of the `Wind` variable, then explain why it appears (to some extent) normally distributed. 
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE

```

## Q3b (7.5 points) 
Create a comparison boxplot that shows the distribution of `Ozone` in each month. Use different colours for each month. 

```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE

```

## Q3c (10 points) 
Create a pairwise matrix of scatterplots of all the numeric attributes in the `airquality` dataset (i.e., `Ozone`, `Solar.R`, `Wind` and `Temp`.)
(Hint: investigate `pairs()` function) 

```{r}
